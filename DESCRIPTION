Title: Functions for plotting discrete and continuous sensor data
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Neil Klepeis
Maintainer: Neil Klepeis <software@klepeis.net>
Description: This package contains functions to plot sensor data, i.e., any data
    derived from "sensing" or "observing" physical and social environmental
    phenomena, including data from chemical sensors, sensors of physical conditions, 
    human activity sensors, biosensors, or dat observed and recorded by a human being
    for specific times.  It has functions to plot discrete contextual timelines and
    continuous data streams, as well as combination plots
    with data for both streams and contexts on the same plot.
    It also has helper functions to convert to standard formats
    for plotting contextual data and data stream data. Uses ggplot2,
    lattice, and plotly plotting libraries to generate both static
    and dynamic interactive plots.
