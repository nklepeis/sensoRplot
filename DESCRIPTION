Title: Functions for plotting discrete and continuous data on sensor levels and positions
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Neil Klepeis
Maintainer: Neil Klepeis <software@klepeis.net>
Description: This R package contains functions to plot data on sensor levels and locations,
    i.e., any discrete or continuous data derived from "sensing" or "observing" physical, social,
    biometric, or environmental phenomena in time and space, including data from chemical sensors,
    sensors of physical conditions, human activity sensors, biosensors, or data observed and recorded
    directly by a human being using their eyes, ears, mouth, nose, skin, etc. acting as "sensors".
    It has functions to plot static and interactive discrete contextual timelines and
    continuous data streams, as well as combination plots containing data for both
    streams and contexts.  It has function to plot static or interactive maps showing
    the locations/trajectories and levels of sensors. It has functions to fit continuous 
    sensor data to a lognormal distribution and create log-probability and density
    plots of sensor levels.  It includes helper functions to convert data between standard formats
    and process or manipulate data files.  It uses the ggplot2, lattice, plotly, and leaflet libraries to generate both static
    and interactive plots and maps.
