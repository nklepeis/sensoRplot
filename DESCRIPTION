Title: Functions for manipulating and visualizing real-time sensor data
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Neil Klepeis
Maintainer: Neil Klepeis <software@klepeis.net>
Description: This R package contains functions to process and plot sensor data,
    i.e., any discrete or continuous data derived from "sensing" or "observing" physical, social,
    biometric, or environmental phenomena in time and space, including data from chemical sensors,
    sensors of physical conditions, human activity sensors, biosensors, or data observed and recorded
    directly by a human being using their eyes, ears, mouth, nose, skin, etc.
    It has functions to (1) plot static and interactive discrete contextual timelines and
    continuous data streams, as well as combination plots containing data for both
    streams and contexts, (2) plot static or interactive maps showing
    the locations/trajectories and levels of sensors, (3) fit continuous 
    sensor data to a lognormal distribution and create log-probability and density
    plots of sensor levels, (4) convert sensor data between standard data formats, and (5) 
    parse, process and manipulate sensor data files. It uses the ggplot2, lattice, plotly, and leaflet libraries
    to generate both static and interactive plots and maps.
